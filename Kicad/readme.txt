This is the schematics from the AP-29 document for the data cassette interface.
2 leds have been added to be able to monitor the data.

The pcb design has been made with a homemade mind.

The backside of the pcb is all 'ground'.
The components are placed (mostly surface mounted) on the 'front' side.

Feel free to change (or make your own) pcb design.
